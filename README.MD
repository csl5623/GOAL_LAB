## GOAL LAB: Ollama Proof of Concept

## Ollama Calculate response time

This project is designed to evaluate the performance and output of different LLaMA3 models (via Ollama) on a list of questions. It tracks the generation time, response content, and saves logs for further analysis.


## Chatbot exploration

This is a Python-based chatbot project utilizing **Ollama's LLaMA3.2:1B** language model. The chatbot maintains a running conversation history and logs user inputs, model responses, and response times.

Installation requirements and instructions to run project can be found in the chatbot folder


## RAG System

This project demonstrates a basic **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built using **Python**, **Ollama**, and **ChromaDB**. The system is designed to answer questions specifically about **U.S. presidents** using only the predefined knowledge provided to the Ollama model.

Installation requirements and instructions to run project can be found in the RAG System folder
